## pylmm - A lightweight linear mixed-model solver

pylmm is a fast and lightweight linear mixed-model (LMM) solver for
use in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The original is derived
from FaST-LMM and that code base can be found
[here](https://github.com/nickFurlotte/pylmm).

This is an improved and faster version of pylmm which is part of the
[Genenetwork2](https://github.com/genenetwork) project.
