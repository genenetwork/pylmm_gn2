* Fast simple LMM resolver

This LMM resolver is a version of FaST-LMM. It is part of
http://genenetwork.org/.

** Multi-core support

Multi-core support is automatic.

** GPU CUDA support

CUDA support is automatic, provided a GPU is installed and
dependencies are working.  pylmm tests for those dependencies and
checks for RAM on the GPU. If these fail the program falls back to the
multi-core edition.

** Input formats

This lmm-resolver supports a minimum of import formats. Conversion
from one file format to another is a separate job and therefore a
separate tool.  At this point a TSV format is supported and a newer
CSV R/qtl format. It may well be the former will be dropped for the
latter in the future. Examples can be found in the data directory.

R/qtl comes with a control file containing a meta description of 
alleles, covariates etc. For more see the rqtlreader.py file.
